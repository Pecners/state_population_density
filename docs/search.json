Located in the southeastern United States, Alabama’s geography includes both the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains and a small bit of coastline along the Gulf of Mexico.\nBoth of these geographical features are apparent in the population density map of the state. Population patterns in the northeast of the state show striations that coincide with mountain ridges, and to the south, the Gulf Shores area and Mobile Bay are clearly visible.",

    "text": "Areas of Note\n\nAlabama’s capital is evident as the most populated area of the state…JK! Birmingham jumps out as the most populous urban area (and smack dab in the middle of the state, at that), but the capital, Montgomery, registers as less than a college town.\nInterestingly, the northeast region of the state, characterized by the southern tail of the Appalachian Mountains, shows broader general population than the southwest (aside from Mobile area). This southwest region largely coincides with the East Gulf Coastal Plain geological section of Alabama.\n\n\n\nSource: Geological Survey of Alabama\n\n\nThe fertile soil of this area attracted the development of cotton plantations in the 19th century, and these plantations were worked by enslaved African Americans. After the civil war, many of these freed slaves stayed in the area–to this day, the population of the Black Belt is majority Black, lending additional meaning to the term.\nSo, to sum up, this southwest coastal plains region has traditionally been devoted to agriculture, a land use that is inherently low-density. Add on top of that the social and political ramifications of slavery and the civil war, one of which being the great migration of African Americans from the southern United States to the north in search of better opportunities.\nI think that gives us a pretty good idea as to why this region is more sparsely populated.",

    "text": "Urban Areas\nAlaska, the Last Frontier. That’s a heck of a population density map, isn’t it? More like lack-of-population-density map, amiright?\nThere are just a handful of population centers that are identifiable. In the central part of the state, we find the two most populous cities: Anchorage and Fairbanks. Neither of those cities is the capital, though – that honor is held by Juneau, situated in the southeast. Outside of those cities, there is an extremely sparese dotting of population across the state.\nPerhaps more notable is the vast amount of blank canvas on this map, though it may not be all that surprising given how far north Alaska is situated.",

Alaska is so sparsely populated that I wanted to add a subtle effect to draw attention to the few population centers. I achieved this effect by changing the texture of the ground so that it reflected the light in a way that mimiced a sheet of ice.\nAs for stars, the sparse spattering of population across the state reminded me of stars in the night’s sky, especially once I landed on the color scheme that matched Alaska’s flag.",

In fact, Alaska boasts more National Park land than the rest of the United States combined.\nTo put this in perspective, the gif below transforms Alaska from its more northern latitudes (which appear larger on maps than latitudes closer to the equator) to those comparable with the contiguous United States. From this perspective, Alaska can cover a large portion of the Midwest.\n\nIn fact, the land area of Alaska is about equal to that of the twelve highlighted states below.",
